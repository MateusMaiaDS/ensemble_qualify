# Introduction: Supervised Statistical Learning

- Suppouse ${\displaystyle X}$ as the vector space of all possible observations.

- Suppouse ${\displaystyle Y}$ as the vector space of all possible outcomes from the observations.

- Given the space of functions ${\mathcal {H}}$ that $f:X\to Y$

### The main objective is to estimate a function $\hat{f}$, from ${\vec  {x}} \in {\displaystyle X}$, and $y \in {\displaystyle Y}$, such that $\hat{f}({\vec  {x}})\sim y$.

# The importance of Ensemble Methods

- The KDD-Cup: The years of (2009-2011) all the first-place and second-place winners used ensemble methods.

- Netflix Prize ($1,000,000).

- Kaggle's Competitions: Among the 29 challenge winning solutions published at Kaggle’s blog during 2015, 17 solutions used XGBoost.

### Regression Problems
 $$\hat{F}_{bag}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^{B}\hat{f}_{b}(\mathbf{x})$$
### Classification Problems
 $$\hat{F}_{bag}(\mathbf{x})=sign\left(\sum_{b=1}^{B}\hat{f}_{b}(\mathbf{x})\right)$$

# Bagging: Pseudo code
1. Sample, with replacement, a *b* dataset of the same size as the whole data set ( *B* bootstraping samples).

1. Train a models to each boostrap sample.

1. The ensemble prediction is given by:

   **the mean** from all predictions from models (for regression tasks)<br/>
   
   **the majority vote** among all models (for classification tasks)

Random forests are a combination of bagged tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest.

# Final comments

- The ensemble methods in the Statistical Learning field demonstred significante relevance as it has been showed in high predictive capacity.

- There are some open questions which can be explored in the ensemble preceedings, e.g: corelation and strength.

# Future Works

- Comparisson between ensemble methods and others competitive methods

- Explore the strength and corelation between models in order to improve the predictive power of ensemble

- Propose new ensemble methods
